Built as a high-concurrency engine utilizing Mautic, Symfony, and a hybrid PostgreSQL/BigQuery architecture, the system provides a unified 'Control Center' for real-time visualization of campaigns, cohorts, and customer lifetime value. Key technical features include a fault-tolerant ETL pipeline with Redis-backed queue management to handle high-velocity signals from Meta, Shopify, and WhatsApp Business. By implementing pre-computed materialized views and advanced multi-tier caching, the dashboard delivers interactive, sub-second reporting for datasets exceeding 10 million records. Strategically, the platform has eliminated manual data reconciliation gaps, reclaiming 60+ man-hours per month and driving a 22% increase in ROAS through precise, data-driven capital allocation. This project serves as a cornerstone for technical stewardship, transforming raw data into a secure, scalable, and actionable strategic asset for high-growth real estate organizations.",

Built using a modular Laravel architecture and a high-interactivity React frontend, the system facilitates seamless coordination between customers, restaurants, and logistics providers. A core technical achievement is the integration of a multi-gateway payment engine (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay) and a real-time POS (Point of Sale) module that synchronizes in-house and online orders. To handle peak-hour traffic spikes, the backend utilizes optimized database indexing and AWS-native caching strategies, ensuring 99.9% uptime and low-latency order processing. Strategically, StackFood has revolutionized restaurant efficiency by digitizing the entire fulfillment lifecycle—from menu management and real-time delivery tracking to automated revenue splitting. This project demonstrates expert-level proficiency in building scalable, real-time SaaS solutions that drive tangible business value through operational automation and data-driven logistics management.",

The architecture features a custom-built PDF rendering engine that processes complex tax calculations and earnings data into standardized financial documents with sub-second performance. Security is a primary pillar, with the platform implementing AES-256 encryption for data at rest and a robust RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system to ensure PII (Personally Identifiable Information) protection. Since its deployment, PayStubx has significantly reduced administrative friction for small-to-medium enterprises, automating what was previously a manual, error-prone payroll task. This project highlights the ability to encode complex financial logic into a secure, user-centric application that delivers immediate operational ROI and technical reliability.",
